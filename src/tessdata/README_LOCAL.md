The contents of this directory, 129 .traineddata files, were **not** developed here. 
They were fulled on *December 20th, 2020* from [the tesseract-OCR github repo](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata).

These trained models were developed by the [tesseract-ocr open source project](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr). 

Later iterations can train their own models and place that data here, but as of this memo being written, all trained models have been created by the above mentioned [tesseract-ocr project](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr). .
